# Getting to know jsx

### Parsing the material

- In order to have correct syntax highlighting for JSX refer to [syntax highlighting for react code in sublime](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41319547/syntax-highlighting-for-react-code-in-sublime).
- If it's still not working [Babel syntax highlighting for React not working?](https://superuser.com/questions/1308848/babel-syntax-highlighting-for-react-not-working).
- Babel, besides converting new JS syntax to JS5 for the browser, also converts jsx to js. 
- Browsers don't understand jsx.
- Copy paste jsx into babeljs.io to see the conversion. Make cure React preset is checked.
- It's a dialect of JS, not HTML.
